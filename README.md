# SET Challenge 2019
This repository is for releases and issue tracking for the 2019 Software Challenge, in which teams control a set of five laser-equipped drones to protect a high value asset.

## Downloading the simulator
Releases of the simulator **for your own machine** can be found on the Releases tab above. Updates will usually be available here before the work network due to certification requirements. Please **do not** put these releases on a work machine.

You don't have to fill out every detail of the template, as long as it's clear what's wrong.
